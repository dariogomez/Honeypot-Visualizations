This repository will have some useful scripts and information that I use for visualizing the data from my Dionaea and Cowrie honeypots.

The file named dfr.sh is a script that was originally posted to my blog at http://www.executemalware.com by R1ckyz1 . I've made a few modifications and reposted it here. This script will install DionaeaFR and all of it's dependencies. 

After the script runs, you will only have to edit the file /opt/DionaeaFR/DionaeaFR/settings.py and change the path to the SQLite database file.
